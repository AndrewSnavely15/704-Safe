# 704-Safe
704 Safe is a natural gas, temperature, and humidity device. Data measurements are stored in Google Cloud Platform's Firebase. Firebase is linked up to Android studio where the mobile application will show graph readings for each sensor. The whole idea is to make a device where it notifies the user when the environment is hazardous to the user.
